                The vaccination awareness session conducted by APL CSR team motivated me to educate people around me
                I encoraged 10 people to get vaccinated and another 20 people to get registered on COWIN portal.
                Educating them about the importance and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination made them feel more confident
                and safe to take right action
            </p>
